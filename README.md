# simple-todo-app
Haven't touched JavaScript in a while so let's build a simple todo app, super original and game breaking idea I know 🤷‍♂️.

I was thinking of keeping things simple with a good ol' vanilla JS + HTML/CSS stack, but TypeScript looks interesting and it's been taking over the JavaScript space these days, so this will be a TypeScript project.
